# Scaling-Tranformation-Techniques-Feature-Engineering

* Machine learning algorithm just sees number â€” if there is a vast difference in the range say few ranging in thousands and few ranging in the tens, and it makes the underlying assumption that higher ranging numbers have superiority of some sort. So these more significant number starts playing a more decisive role while training the model. Thus feature scaling is needed to bring every feature in the same footing without any upfront importance.


#### Types Of Transformation: <br>

>1. Standardization (Standard Scalar) <br>
>2. Scaling to Minimum And Maximum values-(Normalization)-( MinMax Scalar) <br>
>3. Scaling To Median And Quantiles(Robust Scalar) <br>
>4. Guassian Transformations: (When data is not in normal/gaussian distribution) <br>
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4(a) Logarithmic Transformation <br>
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4(b) Reciprocal Trnasformation <br>
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4(c) Square Root Transformation <br>
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4(d) Exponential Trnasformation <br>
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;  4(e) Box Cox Transformation <br>
